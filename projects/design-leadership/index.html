    <p>In the Design Leadership program’s capstone course, “The Competitive Advantage,” students synthesized and applied principles from across the entire curriculum. By the end of the course, they emerged as confident design leaders, equipped to identify opportunities and tackle challenges. This case study delves into the course’s innovative approach to experience design, offering insights for creative directors aiming to cultivate leadership and agility within their teams.<br>
The course mirrored a real-world project environment, organizing students into agile teams with the instructor acting as a product owner. Over sixteen weeks, students prioritized and coordinated tasks through one-week sprints, applying design thinking, estimation, and risk management to authentic design problems. This immersive experience enhanced their abilities in leadership, self-management, and advocacy for design decisions.<br>
Students demonstrated key competencies in various areas. They gathered and analyzed primary and secondary data using participatory research methods tailored to user needs. They pinpointed and defined opportunities through project-appropriate synthesis tools, meeting stakeholder requirements. The course fostered a willingness to generate radical, experimental ideas, pushing students beyond their comfort zones. They made research-driven design decisions and articulated their rationale clearly and compellingly. Creating lo-fi prototypes swiftly gathered user feedback, enhancing project outcomes. Continuous reflection on design practices and project activities encouraged ongoing learning and evolution.<br>
In terms of project planning, students created initial strategic and nimble project plans that facilitated co-ownership and stakeholder buy-in, enabling effective collaboration within constraints. They selected appropriate tools, techniques, and processes for project needs, including comprehensive research plans and guides. Utilizing Lean Startup methodology, students employed empathy methods to identify market realities and customer needs. They crafted solutions that balanced customer desirability, business viability, and technical feasibility.<br>
Storytelling techniques were another crucial component of the course. Students learned to display empathy towards end-users and tailor presentations for diverse stakeholders. They developed multimedia presentations that effectively communicated design concepts. <br>
The development of a design playbook was central to the course, serving as a living document that codified implicit understandings into explicit processes and values. This ensured consistency and efficiency within growing teams, acting as the single source of truth for cross-functional teams and enhancing decision-making and alignment.<br>
User stories were utilized as collaborative design tools to align the team’s understanding of user goals and project objectives. By focusing on the user’s perspective, these stories enhanced team autonomy and confidence. Before class, students completed a survey to articulate their own user stories, which were then integrated into the team agreement, fostering clarity and mutual expectations.<br>
Team working agreements were established to clarify social expectations, boost productivity, and enhance creativity by preventing misunderstandings and conflicts. The course introduced students to various tools and technologies for collaboration, knowledge management, and project management, preparing them for leadership roles in distributed work environments.<br>
Agile practices were emphasized, with students practicing iterative development and estimation techniques to maintain consistent effort through informed sprint planning. They created potentially shippable products each sprint, continuously refining their understanding and solutions. Early competitive analysis informed design decisions, while annotated bibliographies developed students’ skills in synthesizing large amounts of information into actionable insights.<br>
Ethnographic research was another key component, where students created descriptive accounts of target audiences, synthesizing research into clear narratives that informed design decisions. Mapping user and artifact journeys provided insights into user behaviors and interactions, guiding design improvements.<br>
Exploring data sonification as an alternative to visualization ensured accessibility of insights, fostering inclusive design practices. The course emphasized responsible innovation through judicious design, particularly within civic tech, balancing practical and sustainable solutions with user needs.<br>
The Competitive Advantage equipped students with a comprehensive skill set in design leadership, preparing them to navigate and excel in complex, cross-functional environments. By mirroring real-world projects and fostering a deep understanding of agile practices, the course served as a model for experience design in education, offering valuable lessons for creative directors aiming to develop the next generation of design leaders.</p>
